				<h2>Social Security Disability Insurance</h2>
				<h3>What is it?</h3>
				<p> Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is a system of monthly disability benefits paid to individuals
					who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability, usually a 
					physical disability. 
				</p>
				<h3>Who qualifies?</h3>
				<p> According to the Social Security Administration, a person qualifies for SSDI if:
				</p>	
				<ul>
					<li>They cannot do work that they did before;</li>
					<li>They have a physical or mental condition that prevents them from engaging in any “substantial gainful activity”;</li>
					<li>The disability has lasted or is expected to last for at least one year or to result in death; and</li>
					<li>You cannot adjust to other work because of your medical condition(s)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="note">An Initial Denial for SSDI Benefits is Not The Final Decision!</p>
				<h3>What we can do for you:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><h4>Application</h4>
						<p>Attorney Ladas recognizes the extensive amount of paperwork that needs to be completed at this initial 
							level, and is able to assist you in completing the initial Social Security Disability application.
						</p>	
					</li>		
					<li><h4>Reconsideration</h4>
						<p>If the initial application is denied, which often happens, Attorney Ladas will file a request for 
							reconsideration within 60 days of the initial application denial. Then, a person who did not make the 
							first decision will decide your case again.  
						</p>	
					</li>	
					<li><h4>ALJ Hearing</h4>
						<p>If the request for reconsideration is also denied, Attorney Ladas will file an appeal of the reconsideration 
							denial, moving the application to the hearing level before an Administrative Law Judge.
						</p>
					</li>		
				</ul>
