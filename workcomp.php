				<h2>Worker's Compensation</h2>
				<ul class="pointer">
					<li>Worker's Compensation may be paying you benefits - <span class="highlight">but underpaying you</span></li>
					<li>Worker's Compensation may be approving your treatment - <span class="highlight">but with a doctor you don't want</span></li>
					<li>Worker's Compensation may be<span class="highlight">denying	your claim completely</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p> If you are like most people injured at work, the medical bills and lost wages that result from your
					injury can be too difficult to face alone. If you have been injured at work, Attorney J. Stephen 
					Ladas will work to ensure that you receive all of the benefits you are rightfully entitled to. 
					Attorney Ladas will assist you with everything from pursuing your claim for workers compensation 
					benefits to defending you against the insurance company, who will do anything in their power to put
					an end to the benefits you are currently receiving.
 				</p> 
				<p> If you or a loved one find yourself unable to function at the level you should, as a result of a 
					work-related injury, it is crucial that you seek legal representation at once. Your employer and 
					their insurance company have lawyers and experts on their side as well, who will do anything to 
					avoid paying you the benefits you are entitled to. Attorney Ladas will work against the employer’s 
					side to ensure that you receive what is rightfully yours, and he will also, depending on the nature
					of your claim, determine whether you are eligible for additional benefits for:
					<ul class="benefits">
						<li>loss of function</li>
						<li>disfigurement or scarring</li>
						<li>reimbursement for medical treatments, including mileage and prescription medications</li>
					</ul>
