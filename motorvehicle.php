				<h2>Motor Vehicle Accidents</h2>
				<p>The most crucial thing to know is what to do following a motor vehicle accident, and how to protect your interests. 
					Attorney Ladas is committed to assisting clients in such situations, and has some suggestions in order to better 
					assist you if you ever find yourself in a motor vehicle accident. 
				</p>	
				<ol>
					<li><h3>Get Help</h3>
						<p>Try to remain composed. Call an ambulance if necessary, or have someone in close proximity call an ambulance. 
							Do not leave the scene.
						</p>	
					</li>	
					<li><h3>Call The Police</h3>
						<p>Do not leave the scene of the accident without having contacted the police first. It is important and will 
							help your case if there is a police report filed.
						</p>	
					</li>	
					<li><h3>Get Crucial Information</h3>
						<p> Gather as much information from the other driver that you can. Try to get information including name, address, 
							driver's license number, insurance information and telephone numbers. Also locate any witnesses and gather 
							their information. You also want to document any relevant information about the vehicles involved, including 
							the license plate number and make and model. If possible, take pictures of the scene of the accident as well 
							as any damage to yourself or vehicle.
						</p>
					</li>	
					<li><h3>Notify Your Insurance Company</h3> 
						<p>	Notify your insurance company about the accident. Do not speak to the other driver's insurance company. If the 
							other driver does not report it to their insurance company, Attorney Ladas will.
						</p>	
					</li>	
					<li><h3>Protect Your Rights</h3>
						<p> Call our office immediately. We can answer all of your questions and make sure that your rights are protected. 
							Getting medical bills paid and ensuring that the insurance company will cover all of your injuries and damages 
							can be a lengthy and confusing process. Let us take care of it for you.
