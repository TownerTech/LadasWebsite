				<h2>Motorcycle Accidents</h2>
				<p>If you are the driver of a motorcycle and you are hit by a vehicle, you are more likely to sustain 
					serious injuries than if you were the driver of a 4x4 vehicle or even a mid-sized auto. If you or 
					a loved one are injured in a motorcycle accident as a result of another driver's negligence or 
					reckless driving, it is important to seek the representation of an attorney experienced in motorcycle 
					accident cases.

				</p>	
				<p>Attorney J. Stephen Ladas can help to subtantially minimize the time it takes to settle your claim 
					by fighting the bias against motorcyclists and properly presenting the evidence to the insurance 
					company on your behalf. If you are in an accident while riding a motorcycle, the insurance companies 
					will most often times assume you are at blame. Attorney Ladas will thoroughly investigate your case 
					in order to get you the maximum benefits you are entitled to.
				</p>	
				<p>We will help to prove that the defendant displayed negligence leading to the result of your accident. 
					Not only will Attorney Ladas help to establish liability on the part of the defendant, he will also
					help to prove that you sustained injuries as a result of the accident, by gathering evidence from 
					police reports, medical reports, photographs, and testimonies.
